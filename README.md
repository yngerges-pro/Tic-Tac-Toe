# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project allows the computer to play Tic-Tac-Toe with the user

## How it is Created
The programming language that was used for this project is Python.
It has serval functions. One for user and one for computer.
There is also a function for checking mistakes. It makes 
sure that the computer doesn't choose spots from the tic tac toe
table that are already taken. Once that is checked, the no_mistakes
function calls the computer function. Then the user's function 
is called and the game repeats until their is a winner or the user
quits the game by inserting zero.
